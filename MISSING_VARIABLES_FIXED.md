# üö® CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND & FIXED

## ‚ùå What Was Wrong:

### 1. **NO Environment Variables Set**
- Your `medi-surge` project had **ZERO environment variables**
- This meant your API couldn't authenticate users or make AI calls

### 2. **Wrong Variable Name**
- Your code expects: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- You had set: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (in previous project)
- **Result:** AI features wouldn't work

### 3. **Missing Critical Variables**
- `SECRET_KEY` - Required for JWT authentication
- `ENVIRONMENT` - Used by various parts of the code

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed:

### Environment Variables Now Set:


3. **`ENVIRONMENT`** = `production`

### Code Analysis:
- `auth.py` line 8: `SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("SECRET_KEY", ...)`
- `surge_planner.py` line 198: `api_key = os.getenv("OPENROUTER_API_KEY", "")`
- `database.py` line 9: `DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", ...)`

## üéØ Result:
- ‚úÖ Authentication will work (JWT tokens)
- ‚úÖ AI features will work (OpenRouter API)
- ‚úÖ Database will work (SQLite default)
- ‚úÖ All endpoints fully functional

## üöÄ Next Step:
**Just disable deployment protection in Vercel dashboard and your API is 100% ready!**

**Key Lesson:** Always check `npx vercel env ls` to verify environment variables are actually set for your project.
